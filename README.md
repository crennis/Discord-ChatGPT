# Discord-ChatGPT

This Discord-Bot is using OpenAI's new Public available GPT-3.5-Turbo model to be integrated with Discord-Severs. The Bot will be able to differintiate between users since the message the model gets starts with the username of the user who asked the question. It also keeps track of previous conversations.

The Bot is Currently Proof-of-Work and I will Update it with new features in the future. To get the Latest Version of this Bot visit: https://git.crennis.com/crennis/Discord-ChatGPT/

To use this Bot you need a Discord Bot Token and a OpenAI API Key with biling details since GPT3.5-Turbo is not free.
